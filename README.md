# DynamicalCA

This is the repository for the paper "Using Dynamical Systems Theory to Quantify Complexity in Asymptotic Lenia".

In `lyapunov_tutorial.ipynb` we demonstrate the code for calculating the Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors of an arbitrary dynamical system. We then show how to apply this to the Asymptotic Lenia system to calculate the fractal dimension of several dynamic attractors.
